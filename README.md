# RetroFutureScape-Nostalgia-Reimagined
This project was developed as part of the Innerve Tech Fest, with the theme of bringing back nostalgia through games. Inspired by PUBG, I created a game where the player drives a car across different locations to complete various missions. Each successful mission rewards the player with a DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) question to solve, adding an educational twist that counts towards their points.

To enhance the gaming experience, I incorporated three different camera angles: isometric view, top view, and front camera view, allowing the player to switch perspectives based on their preference. The game was built using Unity and C#, and I utilized packages from Sketchfab, Unity Asset Store, and other sources to bring the game to life.

Below is a video for visualization of the project in action.
