# RetroFutureScape-Nostalgia-Reimagined
This project was developed as part of the Innerve Tech Fest, with the theme of bringing back nostalgia through games. Inspired by PUBG, I created a game where the player drives a car across different locations to complete various missions. Each successful mission rewards the player with a DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) question to solve, adding an educational twist that counts towards their points. The combination of nostalgic gaming elements and problem-solving challenges made this project a unique experience.

The game was built using Unity and C#, emphasizing the power of game development in these technologies. Below is a video for visualization of the project in action.
